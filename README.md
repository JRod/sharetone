  Gatsby minimal starter
</h1>

First sprint:

    Build a proof of concept (POC) Gatsby site to test their routing API, builds service, hosting, and Contentful integration
    Use Gatsby’s Contentful plugin and connect to a test Contentful site
    Create the following pages: 
        home 
        about
        and a collection of pages for every city we’re in.
    Build it on Gatsby Cloud and use their preview URL
    Don’t worry about content or styling – this is only a POC. You can display the title of the page on a white background. That is enough for now

Dev, your resume says you’re a little familiar with React, but not with GraphQL. It also looks like you’ve never used a CI/CD tool before.

That’s fine. Gatsby has great documentation and you can skill up as you go.
Here are a few resources to get you started:

    Create a free Contentful account
        Retrieve your Contentful API keys from Settings → API Keys
        The Gatsby wizard will ask you for these keys before scaffolding your site
    Run npm init gatsby in your terminal to quick start a new site
        Choose Contentful as your CMS and add your API keys
        Name your site and folder anything you want
        Choose “responsive images”, “sitemap”, and “metatags”
        Ignore the other options for now. You will use those features in a later sprint!
        Now follow the rest of the “quick start” tutorial I linked to above
    After the tutorial, create pages using Gatsby’s File System Route API (/home, /about, and three cities under a /location route)
    Build and deploy the site on Gatsby Cloud. And you’re done!
